                <p>According to this graph, there appears to be no strong correlation between humidity and a city's latitude. There is a significant, dense spread of cities with a humidity index of 100, ranging from a latitude of ~-57 deg. to ~80 deg. The data does appear to be more concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, which indicates that adding data points in the Southern Hemisphere could alter this conclusion.</p>
